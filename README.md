# Online Bookstore Mock API and Automated Testing

## Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing mock APIs for a hypothetical online bookstore, followed by the development of a comprehensive automated testing suite for these APIs. The mock APIs simulate key functionalities like user registration, user login, book search, adding to cart, and checkout. Automated tests are created to validate these functionalities.
